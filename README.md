# tradePy

## Introduction
## Usage
For now the project only support the crawler to fetch the daily transaction tick data from [TAIWAN FUTURES EXCHANGE](http://www.taifex.com.tw/chinese/3/3_1_2.asp).
#### 1. Crawler.py
The usage is pretty simple as follow:	
	chmod crawler.py
	./crawler.py
For now we haven't support any input parameters, in the future we might add some of them like update, range of date or something worth to do.
